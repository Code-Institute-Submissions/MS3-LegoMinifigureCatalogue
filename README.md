## Milestone Project 3 – Data Centric Development

## Lego Minifigures Catalogue – Python Flask application using MongoDB

The live website hosted by Heroku can be viewed [here](https://lego-minifigure-catalogue.herokuapp.com/).

### Why make a Lego Minifigures Catalogue?

For the third milestone project I decided to build an application where users can add pictures and information of their own Lego Minifigures for others to view and admire, therefore buiding up a community of users that create the catalogue themselves.

Since I was young I was a Lego fanatic. That craze died down in my teens but now that I have children of my own, the love of Lego has returned. What better way to celebrate that than to create a Lego Minifigure Catalogue where people can come together and share their love of Lego.

Lego has come a log way since it began and now there are many themes and types of lego for small children and adults. This has resulted in a vast array of different minifigures for all themes, some of which have since been discontinued. I invite users to upload their own minifigues, unique or common so that others can enjoy the amazing collection.

### How the website works

The users will be directed to the home page initially where there will be an introduction to the site with some explanation on what the site is about and how the users can use it. There will also be several clear buttons to direct the users to either view the catalogue or add their own minifigure. A navigation bar will also be available to help user to navigate around the site.

If a user clicks on ‘View Catalogue’ they will be directed to the full catalogue page where they can view all other minifigures that have currently been added to the database by other users. Here there will also be a function for the users to filter the minifigures by name, theme or age so they can see a specific group of minifigures. There will also be an option to like a minifigure.

Each minifigure in the catalogue can be clicked on to view the additional information that was uploaded by the user. Here there will be an option to edit this information if, for example, something was left out by the user or there is incorrect information uploaded. There will also be a delete option here if a user wishes to delete a minifigure. This will however just hide the minifigure from users and not delete it totally from the database.

When the user goes to the ‘Add a minifigure’ page they will be presented with a form to fill out to upload their own minifigure including photo. After completion they will be redirected to the catalogue where they can view their own minifigure.

Users will also be given the option of adding extra Lego themes that may not yet exist in the database. There will also be options to edit and delete existing themes.

The overall idea is that a community of users will be built up and they will create the catalogue for their own and others enjoyment.

## UX: Strategy

### Primary Target Audience

This website can be enjoyed by anyone who is old enough to use a computer or smartphone. This is a place where lovers of Lego, or people who would like to know more, can come together and share their knowledge and photos.

### Appropriate Content

The Lego world is a predominantly bright and vibrant one and I want my website to reflect that so there will be a few bright colours but also some white background to offset the brightness of the colours. There will be clear separations between different sections of each page with different colours of backgrounds, text and photos with a minimal feel so that there is not too much reading for the user. Clear buttons and text are very important so the user can understand and navigate the site.

### Why this website?

I wanted to create a website with a sense of community where the users have the power and are relied upon to create the catalogue themselves and keep it up to date with accurate information. The theme of Lego is a bonus for me as I am a big fan of Lego.

## Scope

### User Stories

As a potential user I would like to:

- View an amazing Lego Minifigure catalogue and discover minfigs I’ve never seen before
- Add my own photo and minifig info for others to enjoy
- Edit info of other minifigs if something is missing or incorrect
- Delete my minifig if I no longer want others to view it
- Feel part of a community of Lego minifigure lovers by helping to build up the catalogue and keep it up to date with accurate info on all minifigs
- Add new Lego themes, if they are not yet available on the site
- Delete or modify Lego themes if they need updating or have been discontinued
- To view minfigs of a certain theme, age or name
- Be able to view the site on my phone, tablet or laptop
- Have a simple design and clear instructions so I know how the site works
- Have appropriate content for all users, young and old
- Use a website that’s easy on the eye and makes me want to come back to see the latest uploaded minifigs.

As a developer I would like:

- To create a beautiful and user friendly website for fellow Lego lovers.
- For users to enjoy the website and encourage them to upload their own minifigs and help build and maintain the catalogue.
- Show my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask and use of MongoDB with useful functionality built into the website.
- To enjoy using the site myself just like any other user

### Goal

My goal for this project was to create a fun, user friendly and interactive experience for lovers of Lego minifigures. The website will be clear and minimal to provide users with the best experience whilst learning how to use the catalogue. My aim is to make the users feel like they’re part of a community of fellow Lego fans that buildup the catalogue together and help to keep it maintained.

## Structure

### Features

1.	A Lego minifigure head is used as my website logo along with the name of the website in the top left corner of the navigation bar. This is directly imported from a URL on the internet. I think it is a very appropriate logo for the content of the site. The icon and name are together also a link to the home page from anywhere on the site, which a is fairly standard feature of modern websites.
2.  A collapsible navbar element has been implemented for medium and smaller screens. The menu is hidden inside the 'hamburger' icon and the navbar sweeps in from the right when clicked.
3.	A Lego minifigures photo is used as the backdrop of the callout section of the home page. I imported this photo on to the development environment this time as I modified it before upload so that it was cropped a little more. On large screens this appears on the right side of the callout section and moves to the top of the callout section on medium sized (tablet) screens so that the image doesn’t appear too small on this medium screens.
4.	A different photo was used on the callout section for mobile devices. The original photo appears too small at mobile screen size to have the desired effect and experience for the user. This photo is more square in shape, to fit the long mobile screen shape better and shows different minifigures but closer again.
5.	Callout section shows the title of the website along with 2 buttons to either view the catalogue or add a minifig. I think this is a very important part of modern websites that users have buttons to draw them in, when they first arrive, and direct them to other parts of the website, other than using the navbar. In larger screens this section of the callout appears on the left side of the screen and moves under the main photo for medium sized screens, with the website name to the left and the buttons to the right. For mobile devices the elements are all stack on top of one another with the photo at the top, the website name under and the buttons under that. All of this still fits inside a modern standard phone screen size so the user doesn’t have to scroll down to see the whole callout section.
6.	Under the callout section is another section in a different colour to provide some short explanation to the user as to what the site is about and how to use it.
7.	At the bottom of the page is the footer, again in a different colour to clearly differentiate a different section of the website. This contains links and info about the site.
8.	On the ‘View Catalogue’ page the user can view all the current minifigs that have been uploaded onto the site. This initially appears as just a photo and minifig name under with a down arrow beside the name to indicate that more information is available. When you click on the name an additional element appears showing the information associated with that minifig along with 2 other functions, an edit minifig button and a delete minifig button. The arrow beside the name now points up, indicating the associated info can be collapsed again.
9.	When the user clicks on a minifig to reveal the associated info and then clicks on ‘Edit Minifigure’, they are brought to a form to fill in where all the current info for that minifigure is already filled in, therefore if the user only wants to change one field they do not need to fill in the rest of the form. When the user clicks ‘Edit Minifigure ’ at the bottom of the form, the information will be updated and the user will be return to the catalogue where they can view the minifig again and see the updated info.
10.	When the user clicks on a minifig to reveal the associated info and then clicks on ‘Delete Minifigure’ the minifigure will then disappear from view for all users however it will not be completely deleted from the database so that the administrator (myself) can always retrieve the deleted minifigure in the event that it was deleted by accident.
11.	When the user wants to add their own minifig they can click on the ‘Add Minifigure’ button on the homepage callout or navbar and they will be directed to a form to fill out, similar to the edit minifigure form. In this case though they also have the option to upload a photo of their own minifig. Only the photo field will be required and all other fields can be filled if the user knows the information. If not they can leave it blank and that gives other users the opportunity to edit the minifig at a later time and keep the catalogue up to date. Most of the form fields are drop down menus, provided by the database, giving the users a range of options to choose from. This gives consistency as to how the info is presented on the website. When the form is filled out and submitted the user will be redirected back to the catalogue to see their uploaded minifigure.
12.	On the ‘Theme Management’ page the user will have the option to add new Lego themes to the website, should some new ones become available or if existing themes do not yet appear on the website. Once new themes are added they will also appear in the drop down list within the add minifg and edit minfig forms enabling new minifig uploads to use the new themes if necessary.
13.	Users will also have the opportunity to edit and delete existing themes, in the event that the theme is not correct or has been discontinued in the Lego world. To do this users must click on a theme on the ‘Theme Management’ page and a collapsible element will appear showing 2 options, one for edit and one for delete.


## Sketelon

I used the Balsamiq program for the wireframes and attached them to the directory. The original idea is still recognizable from the finished application. There have obviously been some design changes along the way but the wireframe is useful to have to put the idea in your head down on paper before you start coding. The wireframes can also be view her below.<br/>
