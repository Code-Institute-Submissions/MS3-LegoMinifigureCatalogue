## Milestone Project 3 – Data Centric Development 

## Lego Minifigures Catalogue – Flask application using MongoDB

The live website hosted by Heroku can be viewed [here](https://lego-minifigure-catalogue.herokuapp.com/).

### Why make a Lego Minifigures Catalogue?
For the third milestone project I decided to build an application where users can add pictures and information of their own Lego Minifigures for others to view and admire, therefore buiding up a community of users that create the catalogue themselves. 

Since I was young I was a Lego fanatic. That craze died down in my teens but now that I have children of my own, the love of Lego has returned. What better way to celebrate that than to create a Lego Minifigure Catalogue where people can come together and share their love of Lego.

Lego has come a log way since it began and now there are many themes and types of lego for small children and adults. This has resulted in a vast array of different minifigures for all themes, some of which have since been discontinued. I invite users to upload their own minifigues, unique or common so that others can enjoy the amazing collection.

## Sketelon
I used the Balsamiq program for the wireframes and attached them to the directory. The original idea is still recognizable from the finished application. There have obviously been some design changes along the way but the wireframe is useful to have to put the idea in your head down on paper before you start coding. The wireframes can also be view her below.<br/>
