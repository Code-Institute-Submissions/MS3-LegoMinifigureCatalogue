## Milestone Project 3 – Data Centric Development

## Lego Minifigures Catalogue – Python Flask application using MongoDB

The live website hosted by Heroku can be viewed [here](https://lego-minifigure-catalogue.herokuapp.com/).

### Why make a Lego Minifigures Catalogue?
For the third milestone project I decided to build an application where users can add pictures and information of their own Lego Minifigures for others to view and admire, therefore buiding up a community of users that create the catalogue themselves.

Since I was young I was a Lego fanatic. That craze died down in my teens but now that I have children of my own, the love of Lego has returned. What better way to celebrate that than to create a Lego Minifigure Catalogue where people can come together and share their love of Lego.

Lego has come a log way since it began and now there are many themes and types of lego for small children and adults. This has resulted in a vast array of different minifigures for all themes, some of which have since been discontinued. I invite users to upload their own minifigues, unique or common so that others can enjoy the amazing collection.

### How the website works
The users will be directed to the home page initially where there will be an introduction to the site with some explanation on what the site is about and how the users can use it. There will also be several clear buttons to direct the users to either view the catalogue or add their own minifigure. A navigation bar will also be available to help user to navigate around the site.

If a user clicks on ‘View Catalogue’ they will be directed to the full catalogue page where they can view all other minifigures that have currently been added to the database by other users. Here there will also be a function for the users to filter the minifigures by name, theme or age so they can see a specific group of minifigures. There will also be an option to like a minifigure.

Each minifigure in the catalogue can be clicked on to view the additional information that was uploaded by the user. Here there will be an option to edit this information if, for example, something was left out by the user or there is incorrect information uploaded. There will also be a delete option here if a user wishes to delete a minifigure. This will however just hide the minifigure from users and not delete it totally from the database.

When the user goes to the ‘Add a minifigure’ page they will be presented with a form to fill out to upload their own minifigure including photo. After completion they will be redirected to the catalogue where they can view their own minifigure.

Users will also be given the option of adding extra Lego themes that may not yet exist in the database. There will also be options to edit and delete existing themes.

The overall idea is that a community of users will be built up and they will create the catalogue for their own and others enjoyment.

## UX: Strategy

### Primary Target Audience

This website can be enjoyed by anyone who is old enough to use a computer or smartphone. This is a place where lovers of Lego, or people who would like to know more, can come together and share their knowledge and photos.

### Appropriate Content
The Lego world is a predominantly bright and vibrant one and I want my website to reflect that so there will be a few bright colours but also some white background to offset the brightness of the colours. There will be clear separations between different sections of each page with different colours of backgrounds, text and photos with a minimal feel so that there is not too much reading for the user. Clear buttons and text are very important so the user can understand and navigate the site.

### Why this website?
I wanted to create a website with a sense of community where the users have the power and are relied upon to create the catalogue themselves and keep it up to date with accurate information. The theme of Lego is a bonus for me as I am a big fan of Lego.

## Scope

### User Stories
As a potential user I would like to:

- View an amazing Lego Minifigure catalogue and discover minfigs I’ve never seen before
- Add my own photo and minifig info for others to enjoy
- Edit info of other minifigs if something is missing or incorrect
- Delete my minifig if I no longer want others to view it
- Feel part of a community of Lego minifigure lovers by helping to build up the catalogue and keep it up to date with accurate info on all minifigs
- Add new Lego themes, if they are not yet available on the site
- Delete or modify Lego themes if they need updating or have been discontinued
- To view minfigs of a certain theme, age or name
- Be able to view the site on my phone, tablet or laptop
- Have a simple design and clear instructions so I know how the site works
- Have appropriate content for all users, young and old
- Use a website that’s easy on the eye and makes me want to come back to see the latest uploaded minifigs.

As a developer I would like:

- To create a beautiful and user friendly website for fellow Lego lovers.
- For users to enjoy the website and encourage them to upload their own minifigs and help build and maintain the catalogue.
- Show my current knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Flask and use of MongoDB with useful functionality built into the website.
- To enjoy using the site myself just like any other user

### Goal
My goal for this project was to create a fun, user friendly and interactive experience for lovers of Lego minifigures. The website will be clear and minimal to provide users with the best experience whilst learning how to use the catalogue. My aim is to make the users feel like they’re part of a community of fellow Lego fans that buildup the catalogue together and help to keep it maintained.

## Structure

### Features
1.	A Lego minifigure head is used as my website logo along with the name of the website in the top left corner of the navigation bar. This is directly imported from a URL on the internet. I think it is a very appropriate logo for the content of the site. The icon and name are together also a link to the home page from anywhere on the site, which a is fairly standard feature of modern websites.
2.  A collapsible navbar element has been implemented for medium and smaller screens. The menu is hidden inside the 'hamburger' icon and the navbar sweeps in from the right when clicked.
3.	A Lego minifigures photo is used as the backdrop of the callout section of the home page. I imported this photo on to the development environment this time as I modified it before upload so that it was cropped a little more. On large screens this appears on the right side of the callout section and moves to the top of the callout section on medium sized (tablet) screens so that the image doesn’t appear too small on this medium screens.
4.	A different photo was used on the callout section for mobile devices. The original photo appears too small at mobile screen size to have the desired effect and experience for the user. This photo is more square in shape, to fit the long mobile screen shape better and shows different minifigures but closer again.
5.	Callout section shows the title of the website along with 2 buttons to either view the catalogue or add a minifig. I think this is a very important part of modern websites that users have buttons to draw them in, when they first arrive, and direct them to other parts of the website, other than using the navbar. In larger screens this section of the callout appears on the left side of the screen and moves under the main photo for medium sized screens, with the website name to the left and the buttons to the right. For mobile devices the elements are all stack on top of one another with the photo at the top, the website name under and the buttons under that. All of this still fits inside a modern standard phone screen size so the user doesn’t have to scroll down to see the whole callout section.
6.	Under the callout section is another section in a different colour to provide some short explanation to the user as to what the site is about and how to use it.
7.	At the bottom of the page is the footer, again in a different colour to clearly differentiate a different section of the website. This contains links and info about the site.
8.	On the ‘View Catalogue’ page the user can view all the current minifigs that have been uploaded onto the site. This initially appears as just a photo and minifig name under with a down arrow beside the name to indicate that more information is available. When you click on the name an additional element appears showing the information associated with that minifig along with 2 other functions, an edit minifig button and a delete minifig button. The arrow beside the name now points up, indicating the associated info can be collapsed again.
9.	When the user clicks on a minifig to reveal the associated info and then clicks on ‘Edit Minifigure’, they are brought to a form to fill in where all the current info for that minifigure is already filled in, therefore if the user only wants to change one field they do not need to fill in the rest of the form. When the user clicks ‘Edit Minifigure ’ at the bottom of the form, the information will be updated and the user will be return to the catalogue where they can view the minifig again and see the updated info.
10.	When the user clicks on a minifig to reveal the associated info and then clicks on ‘Delete Minifigure’ the minifigure will then disappear from view for all users however it will not be completely deleted from the database so that the administrator (myself) can always retrieve the deleted minifigure in the event that it was deleted by accident.
11.	When the user wants to add their own minifig they can click on the ‘Add Minifigure’ button on the homepage callout or navbar and they will be directed to a form to fill out, similar to the edit minifigure form. In this case though they also have the option to upload a photo of their own minifig. Only the photo field will be required and all other fields can be filled if the user knows the information. If not they can leave it blank and that gives other users the opportunity to edit the minifig at a later time and keep the catalogue up to date. Most of the form fields are drop down menus, provided by the database, giving the users a range of options to choose from. This gives consistency as to how the info is presented on the website. When the form is filled out and submitted the user will be redirected back to the catalogue to see their uploaded minifigure.
12.	On the ‘Theme Management’ page the user will have the option to add new Lego themes to the website, should some new ones become available or if existing themes do not yet appear on the website. Once new themes are added they will also appear in the drop down list within the add minifg and edit minfig forms enabling new minifig uploads to use the new themes if necessary.
13.	Users will also have the opportunity to edit and delete existing themes, in the event that the theme is not correct or has been discontinued in the Lego world. To do this users must click on a theme on the ‘Theme Management’ page and a collapsible element will appear showing 2 options, one for edit and one for delete.

### Features left to implement

### Overall Structure
For the structure of the site I wanted to start off with a large Lego minifigures image on the homepage to capture the users attention and give them a big clue as to what the website is about. Alongside the image will be a callout section with the title of the website and some links to the main sections of the website. 
Along the top of the website will be the navbar with the same links as the callout and some additional ones on the right side. The navbar will have a yellow colour, which is synonymous with Lego, and the title and logo of the site will be in the left side of the navbar. 
A footer which sticks to the bottom of the page will be used as there are a few pages with minimal content so the navbar will always be pushed to the bottom and bot below the final element of the main section.
Most of the pages will also have a blue section somewhere with some explanation of what can be done or needs to be done on that page. This will provide a consistent design so that users will know that this section contains information about this page of the site.
Throughout the site I have also added some single minifigure pictures, within the blue sections, to remind the users that this is what the site is about.

## Sketelon
I used the Balsamiq program for the wireframes and attached them to the directory. The original idea is still recognizable from the finished application. There have obviously been some design changes along the way but the wireframe is useful to have to put the idea in your head down on paper before you start coding. The wireframes can also be view her below.<br/>

## Surface

### Colours and icons
For the colours of the site, I wanted to go with something bright and fun. Something that reflects the Lego world. The colour that is most synonymous with Lego is of course yellow. I decided to go with yellow as the colour of my navbar but a brighter version than the traditional Lego yellow colour. This is because I also wanted to have a Lego minifigure head as the logo of the site and I think it works well against the brighter yellow of the navbar.
Along with the yellow I’ve chosen a bright but rich blue colour as the background for the information sections of each page. Blue and yellow is obviously a classic combination of colours and I think it works well on the site. The yellow and blue are broken up with a few white spaces so the site is not saturated with colour.
I’ve also used the same 2 colours for all the buttons of the site to keep it consistent. Each button also changes to a darker version when hovered over so the user has a visual indicator that the button will do something.
Within most buttons on the site I have also added icons to provide the user with some additional visual indicators as to what the button does. For example a plus icon if you click the ‘Add Minifigure’ button or a downward arrow to indicate that the button will drop down with additional information or links. Icons are also visible in the forms beside each input field as a reference of the content required for that filed.

### Font
For the font I wanted to go with something fun, modern and clear. I searched through Google fonts and decided upon ‘Ubuntu’. I took the link provided by Google and pasted it directly into my CSS file to become the default font for the whole site. There is a backup of San-Serif provided in the event that the browser being used is unable to access Google fonts.

## Technologies Used
* Gitpod – used as my IDE for the development of the website.
* HTML – used to write the code for the structure and layout of all templates in the site
* CSS – used for custom styling of many HTML elements. 
* Materialize – Materialize was used to provide the navbar, footer, forms, collapsible elements for each database record and the use of a grid system. Most of these imported elements have then been custom styled to suit this project.
* Javascript – Used to provide some simple interactive features of the website.
* jQuery – Used to initialize some Materialize components.
* Popper.JS – Used to aid the responsiveness of the website.
* Python – Used for the main functionality of the site. All CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality is provided by Python through flask and other imported technologies in the ‘app.py’ Python file such as PyMongo, flask PyMongo, 
* MongoDB –

## Testing

### Issued found and solved throughout the development

1.	* **Issue** – App not running in Heroku
    * **Fix** – I needed to add the environment variables in Heroku and Gitpod but I had only added them in Gitpod. I also needed to update my requirements file as I had added more dependencies since I first created the file.
    * **Result** – The app can now be run and viewed in Heroku

2.	* **Issue** – For loop not working in page that displays all records from the database.
    * **Fix** – I originally had the for loop, to display all records, outside a list item that contained all the information about the record. However the records was not displaying correctly the way I wanted it. I first tried moving the for loop outside the unordered list tag but eventually realized it needed to be outside the div tag so that a new div was created for each record and that for each div, it would take up the specified amount of horizontal space depending on the screen size.
    * **Result** – The records now display clearly and horizontally the way I wanted them to.

3.	* **Issue** – The photo that was uploaded by the user, from the add minifig form, was not rendering on the page displaying the records.
    * **Fix** – To resolve this I had to rewrite the insert_minifig function so that the image was saved using a save_file method. The image along with all the other data from the form had to be manually created as a dictionary in the same function so that Mongo could interpret all the data together.
                A separate function also had to be written to create a URL for each image, which is then retrieved within the HTML of the main display records page.
    * **Result** – The image uploaded by the user can now be viewed on the main catalogue page along with all the associated data from the form.

4.	* **Issue** – The function to update existing records was not working
    * **Fix** – The original data populated the update form however when the data was changed and the update button was clicked to confirm the changes, the new data was not displayed on the record. This was a simple fix that I had overlooked when first writing the route. I needed to define the methods=[‘POST’] as like the add minifig function we are changing the database which requires a POST method.
    * **Result** – When the update minifig form is filled in and the changes are confirmed the new data can now be viewed within the record on the main catalogue page.

5.	* **Issue** – After a record was updated with extra or amended data, the image file disappeared from view on the updated record
    * **Fix** – In the update records function I needed to use the $set keyword which is used to only update the key/value pairs defined on the function. All data from the undefined key/value pairs, for example the image,  would then remain the same. This $set key word is placed in the function before the dictionary of key/value pairs that are to be updated.
    * **Result** – The update function now works as expected and the data can be changed whilst the image remains part of the record.

6.	* **Issue** – I needed to create a delete function for the project but wanted to make it like a soft delete function where the record does not get deleted from the database.
    * **Fix** – I added an extra key/value pair for every new record of ‘minifig-deleted’ and the value by default set to ‘False’.  This is something that the user cannot see. When the user clicks on delete minifig then instead of deleting completely the ‘minifig_deleted’ value changes to True.
                The get_minifigure route then had to be modified to specify that only records with a key/value pair of ‘minifig_deleted’ that equals to False, would be displayed in the catalogue, otherwise they don’t appear but also don’t get deleted completely. That way I can always reinstate records that may have been deleted by accident as the data is still in the database.
    * **Result** – When a user deletes the minfig records, it no longer appears in the catalogue but is still available in the Mongo database.

7.	* **Issue** – Materialize navbar aligning in the middle of the screen on small and medium devices.
    * **Fix** – When reviewing the site through Google Chrome development tools with the responsive view displayed the navbar items all aligned to the centre when the screen size was set to tablet or smaller. This was a relatively simple fix. I just needed to remove some of the materialize default classes from this element for smaller devices.
    * **Result** – The navbar, when viewed on a smaller device, kept the layout of the large screen with the logo and site title on the left side and the menu or in this case the dropdown menu button, appeared on the right side of the navbar.

8.	* **Issue** – Dropdown select filter function not working. When a theme is chosen from the dropdown menu, nothing happens.
    * **Fix** – When trying to figure out this problem with a Code Institute tutor, we discovered that the href that I had specified inside the select options of the dropdown list, was not visible in the Chrome developer tools. This led me to discover that Materialize select options cannot contain <a> tags and therefore the reason that the function was not being called when a select option was chosen. I was advised by a Code institute mentor on slack to try a dropdown button instead of a dropdown select option. The dropdown button contains list items, which in turn can contain an <a> tag. This appeared to be the solution as the href was now visible on the Chrome developer tools.
                Although the desired href was appearing in developer tools the function was still not filtering the results per theme or age. I was advised through slack to make sure I was looping through the filtered records on the page displaying the records and I had not done that yet. I copied the code block used to display all records and pasted it below wrapped in a new loop that looped through and displayed only the results of the selected theme or age.
                The final sub issue within this general filter issue was that when the filter was finally working and the records for a single theme were only displayed the dropdown button menu was no longer populating to choose a different filter. This was a simple fix as I had not yet added the collections to the new filter routes and therefore they didn’t appear after the first filter was run.
    * **Result** – The filter was working, only showing results from the theme or age range selected and another filter could be applied after the first to filter different options.

9.	* **Issue** – Name filter function not working
    * **Fix** – When I initially started writing this function I was passing a name parameter into the function like I had done with the dropdown menu parameters but I was advised on slack that this was not necessary as I would extract the name from the input form in form of a request just like in the add minifig route.
    * **Result** –
