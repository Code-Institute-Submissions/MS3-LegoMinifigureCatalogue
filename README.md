## Milestone Project 3 – Data Centric Development

## Lego Minifigures Catalogue – Flask application using MongoDB

The live website hosted by Heroku can be viewed [here](https://lego-minifigure-catalogue.herokuapp.com/).

### Why make a Lego Minifigures Catalogue?

For the third milestone project I decided to build an application where users can add pictures and information of their own Lego Minifigures for others to view and admire, therefore buiding up a community of users that create the catalogue themselves.

Since I was young I was a Lego fanatic. That craze died down in my teens but now that I have children of my own, the love of Lego has returned. What better way to celebrate that than to create a Lego Minifigure Catalogue where people can come together and share their love of Lego.

Lego has come a log way since it began and now there are many themes and types of lego for small children and adults. This has resulted in a vast array of different minifigures for all themes, some of which have since been discontinued. I invite users to upload their own minifigues, unique or common so that others can enjoy the amazing collection.

### How the website works

The users will be directed to the home page initially where there will be an introduction to the site with some explanation on what the site is about and how the users can use it. There will also be several clear buttons to direct the users to either view the catalogue or add their own minifigure. A navigation bar will also be available to help user to navigate around the site.

If a user clicks on ‘View Catalogue’ they will be directed to the full catalogue page where they can view all other minifigures that have currently been added to the database by other users. Here there will also be a function for the users to filter the minifigures by name, theme or age so they can see a specific group of minifigures. There will also be an option to like a minifigure.

Each minifigure in the catalogue can be clicked on to view the additional information that was uploaded by the user. Here there will be an option to edit this information if, for example, something was left out by the user or there is incorrect information uploaded. There will also be a delete option here if a user wishes to delete a minifigure. This will however just hide the minifigure from users and not delete it totally from the database.

When the user goes to the ‘Add a minifigure’ page they will be presented with a form to fill out to upload their own minifigure including photo. After completion they will be redirected to the catalogue where they can view their own minifigure.

Users will also be given the option of adding extra Lego themes that may not get exist in the database. There will also be options to edit and delete existing themes.

The overall idea is that a community of users will be built up and they will create the catalogue for their own and others enjoyment.

## UX: Strategy

### Primary Target Audience

This website can be enjoyed by anyone who is old enough to use a computer or smartphone. This is a place where lovers of Lego, or people who would like to know more, can come together and share their knowledge and photos.

### Appropriate Content

The Lego world is a predominantly bright and vibrant one and I want my website to reflect that so there will be a few bright colours but also some white background to offset the brightness of the colours. There will be clear separations between different sections of each page with different colours of backgrounds, text and photos with a minimal feel so that there is not too much reading for the user. Clear buttons and text are very important so the user can understand and navigate the site.

### Why this website?

I wanted to create a website with a sense of community where the users have the power and are relied upon to create the catalogue themselves and keep it up to date with accurate information. The theme of Lego is a bonus for me as I am a big fan of Lego.

## Sketelon

I used the Balsamiq program for the wireframes and attached them to the directory. The original idea is still recognizable from the finished application. There have obviously been some design changes along the way but the wireframe is useful to have to put the idea in your head down on paper before you start coding. The wireframes can also be view her below.<br/>
